# SkinDetector
skinDetectector basically a skin disease/canser detection app which is used to scan and detect the skin disease
I have used CNN model in ML to make this application. 
How it works - Basically you hacve to scan or upload image of skin prone area which then scan and detect which deisec is you have, It's not 100% sure, but it can prdict more than 70% to 80%.
I have use dataset of imges which i have train into model so it can detect the disease.
